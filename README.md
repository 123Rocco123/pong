# pong
Atari's 1972 classic, implemented in Lua with LÖVE


# About The Code
Most of the code has been forked from the "games50/pong" repository for CS50x Online Course offered by Harvard.

The goal of this repository is to develop my skills as a Lua programmer given that I don't have much experience with the language or with Löve (game engine).

# Goals
1) Have the ability to cycle between:
   - PVP
   - AI vs Player
   - AI vs AI
2) Levels
3) AI Difficulty
4) Color Scheme Change
